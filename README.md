## üöÄ Quickstart local DEV environment

1. Make sure you're running [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Install dependencies with `bun i`
3. Run unit test watcher with `bun run test:dev`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Settings

> Settings are used to configure the tool in a [Component Manager config file](./webcm.config.ts.docker-example)

## Testing

Using [WebCM](https://webcm.dev/getting-started/install) you are able to run the Managed Component locally.

```bash
npx webcm components/posthog/index.js
```

**NOTE:** [WebCM](https://github.com/cloudflare/webcm) doesn't run on newer versions of NodeJS, so you may need to use `nvm` to switch to an older version or use the following Docker command

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/home/node/app/ -w /home/node/app/ -p 1337:1337 -p 8000:8000 node:18 npx webcm components/posthog/index.js
```

OR

```bash
docker compose up
```

**NOTE:** If you are using Docker, you can access a running local site at <http://192.168.1.1:8080>, but you need to set `target:` to an address the container can connect to (`localhost` in the container, is not the same as `localhost` when called on your host) and `hostname: 'webcm'` in your [webcm.config.ts](./webcm.config.ts) file (see `./webcm.config.ts.docker-example`).

## Deployment

```bash
bunx managed-component-to-cloudflare-worker ./components/posthog/index.js zaraz-posthog
```

Then you can configure it as tool using the Cloudflare Zaraz Dashboard at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/zaraz/tools-config/tools/catalog>, look for "Custom Managed Component" and select the `custom-mc-zaraz-posthog` tool. Set the Tool Name to "PostHog" & enable "E-commerce tracking"
