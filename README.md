## üöÄ Quickstart local dev environment

1. Make sure you're running [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Install dependencies with `bun i`
3. Run unit test watcher with `bun run test:dev`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Settings

> Settings are used to configure the tool in a Component Manager config file

`exampleSetting` can be the pixelID or any other essential/optional setting like the option to anonymize IPs, send ecommerce events etc.

## üß± Fields Description

> Fields are properties that can/must be sent with certain events

### Human Readable Field Name `type` _required_

- **`POSTHOG_API_KEY`** personal PostHog API key

## Testing

Using [WebCM](https://webcm.dev/getting-started/install) you are able to run the Managed Component locally.

```bash
npx webcm components/posthog/index.js
```

**NOTE:** [WebCM](https://github.com/cloudflare/webcm) doesn't run on newer versions of NodeJS, so you may need to use `nvm` to switch to an older version or use the following Docker command

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/home/node/app/ -w /home/node/app/ -p 1337:1337 -p 8000:8000 node:18 npx webcm components/posthog/index.js
```

OR

```bash
docker compose up
```

**NOTE:** If you are using Docker, you can access a running local site at <http://192.168.1.1:8080>, but you need to set `target:` to an address the container can connect to (`localhost` in the container, is not the same as `localhost` when called on your host) and `hostname: 'webcm'` in your [webcm.config.ts](./webcm.config.ts) file (see `./webcm.config.ts.docker-example`).

## Deployment

```bash
npx managed-component-to-cloudflare-worker ./index.js my-new-counter-mc
```
